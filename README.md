## Further work

The MERIT seems to perform poorly in very mountainous areas. Maybe because STRM has the same issue? 
See <https://forum.earthdata.nasa.gov/viewtopic.php?t=2388>. Also a peak and the nearby steep slopes will have
issues.

Can we special case what we have as the tallest point on a mountain as the actual summit?
