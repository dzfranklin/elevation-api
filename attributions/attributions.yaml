    OS Terrain® 50 is a three-dimensional digital terrain model (DTM) of Great Britain. A DTM primarily defines the
    ground surface, having removed all protruding features (such as buildings and trees) elevated above the
    bare earth.

    This is the highest resolution seamless DEM dataset for the U.S. with full coverage of the 48 conterminous states,
    Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. territories. Ground spacing is approximately 10 meters north/south, but variable east/west
    due to convergence of meridians with latitude.
